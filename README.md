agileMantis
===========

Enables the Scrum Framework to your Mantis-Installation

With agileMantis gadiv intends to bridge the gap between the bugtracking system MantisBT and on agile software development with scrum which are two proven tools of modern software development.

MantisBT manages requirements for software products. These requirements are represented by trackers that can be picked up and processed for defined target versions of the software. The trackers are similar to User Stories in Scrum. However MantisBT provides no further funds which support the software development process using Scrum. With the development of agileMantis this gap has been closed by gadiv.

agileMantis expands MantisBT with components for project management with scrum. It is a plug-in for existing Mantis installations.

The user is provided all necessary functions in order to successfully work with scrum. The ability to create Scrum teams, to maintain product backlogs and to assign Mantis projects to them is as well part of agileMantis as setting up and processing of sprints.

agileMantis supports the staffing process of a project by managing available capacities of team members (and across teams) for a sprint or a specific period of time.

A Mantis bug tracker can be defined as a user story that can be assigned to a product backlog and thus included in a sprint. Within a user story tasks can be created and edited.

gadiv is currently developing the following components for agileMantis expert version: Task board with special functions for daily scrum meeting and statistical functions (velocity, burndown charts, etc.). For this purpose licenses can be purchased at gadiv.
